# topic-bot
Discord bot that suggests topics for conversation when chat is dead

# Usage
To use in a discord channel, use the command ```!topic```

# How to Contribute
Provide more conversation topics but keep them SFW (safe for work) and do not include controversial topics such as politics, religion etc. 

Add a ```.txt``` file in the ```topics``` directory with the filename being the category of conversation topics. For example, topics related to animals should go in ```animals.txt```. Before adding a new file please check if a file with the category already exists.
Alternatively edit the already existing ```.txt``` files by adding more conversation topics.
